## Programming with JavaScript
This page is about all that I learned in the three sections that were assigned.  Intro + Script will be discussed first, then Expressions + Operations, and finally functions.  

### Intro + Script (1-24)
JavaScript can makes webpages intereactive through various means, including buttons, functions, and loops.  Forms are covered in Ch.13.  Core concepts, like events and selective reloading, are covered in the first 9 chapters.  In Ch. 10 - 13, practical application topics such as debugging and sorting data are covered. 

WHat are Scripts?  "A series of instructions a computer can follow to achieve a goal" (Duckett 14).  To have a well-run script, the designer need to:
- define the goal
- design the script
- code each step

Writing a script involves steps.  See p.20-22 for examples. 

### Expressions + Operators (74-79)

Two types of expressions:
1. Expressions that asign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

Expressions rely on operators, which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values (Duckett, 75). [example](operatorsjs.jpg)

String operators are another variation.  
   `var cost1 = '7';
    var cost2 = '9'; 
    var total = cost1 + cost 2;`

The result is 79 and not 16.  

### Functions (88-94)

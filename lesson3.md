## LESSON THREE: REVISIONS IN THE CLOUD

:rocket: For starters :rocket:  let this be a lesson in being fastidious and thorough; I read the whole thing! The directions were pretty clearn and I went past them -- oops. It wasn't a waste of time, but it was more than was required.  I found it somewhat confusing and abstract.  

What did I learn | What did I not learn
 ------------ | ------------- 
 Basics of what repositories are | All of the functions of repositories  
 That Udemy is a useful resource | As much as I wanted to know about Terminal 
 
 

### What can I do now?

- [x] practice Terminal commands to learn the basics
- [x] browse Udemy for courses
- [ ] go on an airplane (as of 4.23.20
- [x] learn more!

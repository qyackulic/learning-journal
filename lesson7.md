## Computers.  What are they? How do they work?  

Computrs are tools that make intellectual exercises more efficient.  Compared to the hammer or train, which are physical tools, the computer was a ground-breaking innovation. 

#### Binary 

>   1001 translates to 9 in binary. 
    2001 is not binary.  
    Why?  Binary represents numbers using 1s and 0s.  And so on. 

###### Smaller circuits and faster processing. 

- This is not necessarily true; smaller circuits don't by nature result in faster processing.  However, since the advent of computuers, circuit size has shrunk exponentially.  Now, they can fit on your thumb and make billions of calculations a second.  

Why computers are cool |  What is unkown
------------ | ------------- 
They're integral tools | [Are we too dependent?](https://qyackulic.github.io/ned_ludd/)
Fans keep computers cool | The details of how that works are still unkown, even to high-level engineers

Four steps are key to computer functionality
1. input 
1. storage
1. processing
1. output
> these four steps allow humans to use computuers without having to        understand everything.  Simply, input, "wait" for output, and then recieve output.  Usually, the output is very quick.

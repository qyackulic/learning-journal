## Text Editors 

In the words of [Ryan](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php), the terminal can be used to perform various functions, such as `lr`, `pwr`, and `file`.  

Text editors are also useful devices.  Serve many functions.  Visual Studio Code is an example of a text editor.

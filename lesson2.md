## Groth Mindset

A growth mindset is, among other things, the ability to take on failure and adversity, to not be belittled by challenged, and to get up and try again.  It is also a love of learning, because learning is one pathway to self-improvement.  And only scrooges with rigid minds don't want to improve themselves.  Nobody wants to be a scrooge.  

Other ways to improve your growth mindset include:
   - [x] healthy foods, like soy beans and jade rice
   - [x] skateboarding
   - [x] getting the news from a variety of sources
   - [x] drinking lots of water
   
In truth, most things can contribute to a ``growth mindset``.  It hinges on your attitude!

# Quinn's Learning Journal

Greetings and salutations.  Welcome to my GitHub learning blog for Code Fellows 102.   

### [**About**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) 

I aspire to survive the pandemic.  Aside from that, I am learning coding because I think it will add to my quiver of skills. Maybe it will become a career.  Who knows.  I want to learn Python and the concommitant repertoire. 

I wish you the best on your studies in becoming a programmer and that you enjoy yourself along the [way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPd_awQuH4o).

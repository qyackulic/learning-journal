## True Git...Hub

GitHub is a  resource designed for programmers and tinkerers and the like.  A variety of functions exist on GitHub to make programming easier and accessible.  

Git, on the other hand, is more of a tool/ system used by programmers to organize things. It performs command like 

> `git add filename`  --> add function 

> `git rm filename` --> remove function

> `git --help`  --> this command presents a list of various functions that `git` performs

### Stretch goals

:rocket: I want to learn more about terminal.  It seems like a useful tool.  However, it is currently pretty useless to me because I know little about how it operates and what it does. 

:rocket: Udemy [offers](https://www.udemy.com/course/github-ultimate/) [courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-complete-guide/) on the topic.  Now -- that is, at my introdction to coding -- seems like a opportune time to sign up, in addtion to this course.

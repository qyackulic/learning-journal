## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) --ch10
CSS compliments and works with HTML.  It adds style and design to the otherwise bland layout.  Like flowers to a garden, CSS can make your webpage pop.  

CSS can either be used externally, that is, from a seperate git documents or source, or from the same line of code.  I practiced mostly doing external edits, but I look forward to experimenting with internal editing.  That seems like the more efficient method of editing, in some cases, because the code can be written in tandem.  So, you can make the `<p> PARAGRAPH </p>` and then write the CSS design, with something like `<style type="text/css">` and then define the elements of `p` by writing `p {font-family: arial; yada yada}`.  This seems somewhat more efficient then doing a seperate documents, but I also imagine that another document may be easier to edit.  

## Color -- ch11

:rocket: Color is a useful way to flash up your website.  But, according to the book, it is important to make sure that the chosen colors do not clash too much and that one color is not over-dominant (Duckett, 255).
